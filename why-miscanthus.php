					<p>Renew Biomass is revolutionizing the biomass industry with technology and processes that makes Miscanthus production a viable and long-term source of renewable biomass.  In the past mass production of Miscanthus wasnâ€™t considered possible due to limitations on planting technology, but our proprietary methods for planting and processing this crop allow Miscanthus production with ease that was never before thought possible.</p>
					<h4>What are the benefits of Miscanthus?</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Low Inputs - Unlike other crops that must be planted annually, Miscanthus only has to be planted once while still reaping an annual harvest.</li>
						<li>Long Term Supply - The supply and ability to produce Miscanthus is almost limitless. The more we need the more we can produce.</li>
						<li>Eco Friendly - Made with all natural materials and light manufacturing methods, both production and disposal of this product has a minimal carbon footprint. In some applications the carbon impact may even be negative.</li>
						<li>Grows on Marginal Land - It has long been thought that marginal land would someday be of use in planting non food crops. That day is finally here. Miscanthus has been shown to perform as well or better on marginal land.</li>
