					<h4>Our History</h4>
					<p>Renew Biomass is an innovative company dedicated to Rural America. In our current project areas we have worked with over 150 farmers to establish more than 8,000 acres of Miscanthus crop. You will find our independently owned and operated farmers spread out over Southwest Missouri, Central Missouri, and Northeast Arkansas. Our corporate office is located in Springfield, Missouri with a conversion facility in operation nearby and another slated for Northeast Arkansas in the coming years</p>
					<h4>Our Process</h4>
					<p>We have created a vertically integrated renewable supply chain. This allows us to maintain a watchful eye over our product from start to finish so that we can deliver a consistent, high-quality product. We take pride in being a part of the process from planting in the fields to processing at our state of the art manufacturing facility.
